abstract = {The fusion of visual and inertial cues has become popular in robotics due to the complementary nature of the two sensing modalities. While most fusion strategies to date rely on filtering schemes, the visual robotics community has recently turned to non-linear optimization approaches for tasks such as visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), following the discovery that this comes with signifi- cant advantages in quality of performance and computational complexity. Following this trend, we present a novel approach to tightly integrate visual measurements with readings from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in SLAM. An IMU error term is integrated with the landmark reprojection error in a fully probabilistic manner, resulting to a joint non-linear cost function to be optimized. Employing the powerful concept of ‘keyframes' we partially marginalize old states to maintain a bounded-sized optimization window, ensuring real-time opera- tion. Comparing against both vision-only and loosely-coupled visual-inertial algorithms, our experiments confirm the benefits of tight fusion in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

abstract = {Simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) has been the focus of intensive research in the last decade due to the potential benefits it offers to the field of autonomous mobile robotics. SLAM is concerned with the ability of an autonomous vehicle to navigate through an unex- plored environment and incrementally construct a map of the environment and localise itself within this map. This thesis describes an entirely vision-based, large-area, 6DoF SLAM sys- tem that was developed specifically for real-time deployment on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a calibrated stereo system. This SLAM system is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and incorporates a novel approach to landmark description and data association in which landmarks are essentially local submaps that consist of a cloud of 3D points and their associated SIFT or SURF descriptors. Furthermore, landmarks are sparsely distributed in the constructed map which greatly simplifies and accelerates data association and map updates. In addition to performing localisation based on landmark observations the system also performs visual odometry and predicts vehicle motion using a constant-velocity model. For a simulated 87m long 3D loop trajectory the mean squared localisation error of the system was 3.16 and the maximum absolute error in roll, pitch and yaw angles was 11.6 o , 24.3 o and 24.4 o respectively when the stereo and landmark correspondences contained Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.1 pixels and 10{\%} of correspondences were outliers. This thesis represents an important contribution to entirely vision-based 6DoF SLAM as very few implementations currently exist, and the approach utilised in this thesis achieves comparable results and has the potential to operate in real-time.},

@article{Bloesch2015,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a monocular visual- inertial odometry algorithm which, by directly using pixel intensity errors of image patches, achieves accurate tracking performance while exhibiting a very high level of robustness. After detection, the tracking of the multilevel patch features is closely coupled to the underlying extended Kalman filter (EKF) by directly using the intensity errors as innovation term during the update step. We follow a purely robocentric approach where the location of 3D landmarks are always estimated with respect to the current camera pose. Furthermore, we decompose landmark positions into a bearing vector and a distance parametrization whereby we employ a minimal representation of differences on a corresponding -Algebra in order to achieve better consistency and to improve the computational performance. Due to the robocentric, inverse- distance landmark parametrization, the framework does not require any initialization procedure, leading to a truly power- up-and-go state estimation system. The presented approach is successfully evaluated in a set of highly dynamic hand-held experiments as well as directly employed in the control loop of a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).},

@article{Bonin-Font2014a,
abstract = {This paper proposes a straightforward but effective approach to per-form visual SLAM, especially suitable for underwater vehicles. One of the most important steps in this procedure is the image registration method, since it reinforces the data association and thus makes it possible to close loops reliably. Since the traditional EKF-SLAM approaches are usually costly in terms of running time, the approach presented in this paper strengthens this method by adopting a trajectory-based schema that re-duces the computational requirements. The pose of the vehicle is esti-mated using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which predicts the vehi-cle motion by means of a visual odometer and corrects these predictions using the data associations (loop closures) between the current frame and the previous ones. Since the use of standard EKFs entail linearization er-rors that can distort the vehicle pose estimations, the approach was also tested using an Iterated Kalman Filter (IEKF) instead. The approach has been tested on real underwater vehicles, in controlled scenarios and in shallow sea waters. The approach has shown an excellent performance in diverse experiments, with very limited errors of the estimated trajectory.},

@article{Yang2016,
abstract = {— Existing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm is not robust in challenging low-texture environments because of few salient features. The resulting sparse or semi-dense map also conveys little information for motion planning. Though some work utilize plane or scene layout for dense map regularization, they require decent state estimation from other sources. In this paper, we propose a real-time monocular plane SLAM to demonstrate that scene understanding could improve both state estimation and dense mapping especially in low-texture environments. The plane measurements come from the pop-up 3D plane model from each single image. We also combine planes with point based SLAM to solve the ill-constrained problems. On a public TUM dataset, our algorithm generates dense semantic 3D model with pixel depth error of 6.2 cm while existing SLAM fails. On a 60 m long dataset with loops, our method creates a much better 3D model with state estimation error of 0.67 {\%}.},

The main contribution of this paper is the construction of a pose graph as the front-end part of the normal GraphSLAM algorithm. The proposed algorithm has three stages as follows: 1) scan generation which incorporates a novel Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based algorithm that takes the fish motion into account; 2) data association which is based on Mahanalobis distance and shape matching for determining loop closures; 3) scan matching which is for constraints calculation and pose graph construction. The constructed pose graph is then fed into a back-end optimizer - g2o for finding the optimal position of robotic fish. The viability and the accuracy of the proposed algorithm are verified by extensive simulations, compared with the dead reckoning and scan matching approaches.},

It obtains approximately 2m and 6 degrees accuracy for very large scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 10 degrees accuracy indoors. Using a Bayesian convolutional neural network implementation we obtain an estimate of the model's relocalization uncertainty and improve state of the art localization accuracy on a large scale outdoor dataset. We leverage the uncertainty measure to estimate metric relocalization error and to detect the presence or absence of the scene in the input image. We show that the model's uncertainty is caused by images being dissimilar to the training dataset in either pose or appearance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we show that all processes associated with the move-sense-update cycle of extended Kalman filter (EKF) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) can be carried out in time linear with the number of map features. We describe Divide and Conquer SLAM, which is an EKF SLAM algorithm in which the computational complexity per step is reduced from O(n 2) to O(n), and the total cost of SLAM is reduced from O(n 3) to O(n 2). Unlike many current large-scale EKF SLAM techniques, this algorithm computes a solution without relying on approximations or simplifications (other than linearizations) to reduce computational complexity. Also, estimates and covariances are available when needed by data association without any further computation. Furthermore, as the method works most of the time in local maps, where angular errors remain small, the effect of linearization errors is limited. The resulting vehicle and map estimates are more precise than those obtained with standard EKF SLAM. The errors with respect to the true value are smaller, and the computed state covariance is consistent with the real error in the estimation. Both simulated experiments and the Victoria Park dataset are used to provide evidence of the advantages of this algorithm.},

The stereo constraints of our system allow a robust initialization – avoiding the well-known bootstrapping problem in monocular systems–and the recovery of the real scale. Both aspects are essential for its practical use in real robotic systems that interact with the physical world.

In this work we present a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm solved by an Extended Information Filter (EIF) for agricultural environments (olive groves). The SLAM algorithm is implemented on an unmanned non-holonomic car-like mobile robot. The map of the environment is based on the detection of olive stems from the plantation. The olive stems are acquired by means of both: a range sensor laser and a monocular vision system. A support vector machine (SVM) is implemented on the vision system to detect olive stems on the images acquired from the environment. Also, the SLAM algorithm has an optimization criterion associated with it. This optimization criterion is based on the correction of the SLAM system state vector using only the most meaningful stems - from an estimation convergence perspective - extracted from the environment information without compromising the estimation consistency. The optimization criterion, its demonstration and experimental results within real agricultural environments showing the performance of our proposal are also included in this work. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, we solve the traditional problem of autonomous Localization and Mapping by inter- leaving planning for exploring unknown environments by a mobile robot and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We denote such planned SLAM systems as SPLAM (Simultaneous Planning Lo- calization and Mapping). The main aim of SPLAM is to plan paths for the SLAM process such that the robot and map uncertainty upon execution of the path remains minimum and tractable. The planning is interleaved with SLAM and hence the terminology SPLAM. While typical SPLAM routines find paths when the robot traverses amidst known regions of the constructed map, herein we use the SPLAM for- mulation for an exploration like situation. Exploration is carried out through a frontier based approach where we identify multiple frontiers in the known map. Using Randomized Trajectory Generation tech- niques we calculate various possible trajectories to all the known frontiers. A practical SPLAM system must be fast and also be able to handle presence of dynamic objects in the environment. We've provided solutions to these two problems separately. For developing a fast planning system we introduce a novel strategy for selecting the trajectory which mimics Fast SLAM, selects a trajectory for robot motion that will minimize the map and robot state covariance. By using a Fast SLAM like approach for selecting frontiers we are able to decouple the robot and landmark covariance resulting in a faster selection of next best location, while maintaining the same kind of robustness of an EKF based SPLAM framework. We then compare our results with Shortest Path Algorithm and EKF based Planning. We show significant reduction in covariance when compared with shortest frontier first approach, while the uncertainties are comparable to EKF-SPLAM albeit at much faster planning times. For planning in Dynamic Environments while the typical planning methods for Dynamic Environ- ments involve filtering the dynamic objects and then planning for the static environment thereafter ob- tained, we've developed a novel planning algorithm which is intelligently able to decide whether to keep or discard the dynamic objects. If we are able to make use of them to aide localization they are kept in the SLAM framework, but if found hindering the localization they are discarded. For this, along with selecting one of the trajectories generated through the Trajectory Generation system, we also comes up with an action policy. This action policy dictates what action, from a given set of actions, will the robot take at each node of the trajectory. Also for the process of SLAM which is intermediate to planning, we devise a EKF-SLAM based framework which is capable of incorporating Dynamic Objects as opposed to the traditional SLAM methods. We then compare our results with a method that unilaterally filters all moving objects, which we call as the dynamic object filtering method or simply filtering method in short. We show significant reduction in robot and map uncertainty when compared with the dynamic object filtering planning method, for both simulated and real environments.},

abstract = {Finding the relationship between two coordinate systems using pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

Experiments have been conducted using a real underwater vehicle in controlled scenarios and in shallow sea waters, showing an excellent performance with very small errors, both in the vehicle pose and in the overall trajectory estimates.itional EKF-SLAM approaches are usually expensive in terms of execution time; the approach presented in this paper strengthens this method by adopting a trajectory-based schema that reduces the computational requirements. The pose of the vehicle is estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), which predicts the vehicle motion by means of a visual odometer and corrects these predictions using the data associations (loop closures) between the current frame and the previous ones. One of the most important steps in this procedure is the image registration method, as it reinforces the data association and, thus, makes it possible to close loops reliably. Since the use of standard EKFs entail linearization errors that can distort the vehicle pose estimations, the approach has also been tested},

We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer: one thread deals with the task of robustly tracking erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

We describe a relative simultaneous localisation and mapping system (RSLAM) for the constant-time estimation of structure and motion using a binocular stereo camera system as the sole sensor. Achieving robustness in the presence of difficult and changing lighting conditions and rapid motion requires careful engineering of the visual processing, and we describe a number of innovations which we show lead to high accuracy and robustness. In order to achieve real-time performance without placing severe limits on the size of the map that can be built, we use a topo-metric representation in terms of a sequence of relative locations. When combined with fast and reliable loop-closing, we mitigate the drift to obtain highly accurate global position estimates without any global minimisation. We discuss some of the issues that arise from using a relative representation, and evaluate our system on long sequences processed at a constant 30–45 Hz, obtaining precisions down to a few meters over distances of a few kilometres.},

In this way, we perform simultaneous localization and mapping in the configuration space of the robot, rather than in the pose space of the camera. We show using simulations and robot experiments that our approach greatly reduces both 3D reconstruction error and joint angle error over simply using the forward kinematics. Unlike other approaches, ours directly reasons about robot joint angles, and can use these to constrain the pose of the sensor. Because of this, it is more robust to missing or ambiguous depth data than approaches that are unconstrained by the robot's kinematics.},

The proposed method exploits the programmable spatial sampling capabilities of the 3D sonar system to derive from the same set of received echo signals both an accurate representation of reflectors in the horizontal plane (2D energyscape) and a more coarse representation of reflectors in the frontal hemisphere (3D energyyscape). Using a mapping experiment we demonstrate that the motion estimates originating from the acoustic flow module combined with the coarse frontal hemisphere data provide sufficient information for the mapping module to reconstruct the robot's trajectory.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to the multi-robot map-alignment problem that enables teams of robots to build joint maps without initial knowledge of their relative poses. The key contribution of this work is an optimal algorithm for merging (not necessarily overlapping) maps that are created by different robots independently. Relative pose measurements between pairs of robots are processed to compute the coordinate transformation between any two maps. Noise in the robot-to-robot observations, propagated through the map-alignment process, increases the error in the position estimates of the transformed landmarks, and reduces the overall accuracy of the merged map. When there is overlap between the two maps, landmarks that appear twice provide additional information, in the form of constraints, which increases the alignment accuracy. Landmark duplicates are identified through a fast nearest-neighbor matching algorithm. In order to reduce the computational complexity of this search process, a kd-tree is used to represent the landmarks in the original map. The criterion employed for matching any two landmarks is the Mahalanobis distance. As a means of validation, we present experimental results obtained from two robots mapping an area of 4,800 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}},

However, if the video frames contain only a few 2D feature correspondences with a good baseline, or the camera only rotates without sufficient translation in the beginning, tracking and mapping becomes unstable. We introduce a real-time visual SLAM system that incrementally tracks individual 2D features, and estimates camera pose by using matched 2D features, regardless of the length of the baseline. Triangulating 2D features into 3D points is deferred until key frames with sufficient baseline for the features are available. Our method can also deal with pure rotational motions, and fuse the two types of measurements in a bundle adjustment step. Adaptive criteria for key frame selection are also introduced for efficient optimization and dealing with multiple maps. We demonstrate that our SLAM system improves camera pose estimates and robustness, even with purely rotational motions.},

Besides the devel- opment and validation of the visual SLAM algorithm, the methodology for its evaluation is a key aspect of this work. The resulting SURE-SLAM algo- rithm uses a stereo camera system and basic vehicle sensors (AHRS, DPS) to compute a complete, error-bounded localization solution for underwater vehicles in real-time with similar quality as state-of-the-art acoustically sta- bilized dead-reckoning approaches. The robustness of the algorithm as well as its limitations and failure-cases are established by extensive field testing with the AUV Dagon, which was developed during this thesis as test and evaluation vehicle.},

abstract = {— A novel closed-form solution for pose-graph SLAM is presented. It optimizes pose-graphs of particular structure called pose-chains by employing an extended version of trajectory bending. Our solution is designed as a back-end optimizer to be used within systems whose front-end performs state-of-the-art visual odometry and appearance based loop detection. The optimality conditions of our closed-form method and that of state-of-the-art iterative methods are discussed. The practical relevance of their theoretical differences is investigated by extensive experiments using simulated and real data. It is shown using 49 kilometers of challenging binocular data that the accuracy obtained by our closed-form solution is comparable to that of state-of-the-art iterative solutions while the time it needs to compute its solution is a factor 50 to 200 times lower. This makes our approach relevant to a broad range of applications and computational platforms.},

abstract = {The use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for underwater tasks is a promising robotic field. These robots can carry visual inspection cameras. Besides serving the activities of inspection and mapping, the captured images can also be used to aid navigation and localization of the robots. Visual odometry is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images. It has been used in a wide variety of non-standard locomotion robotic methods. In this context, this paper proposes an approach to visual odometry and mapping of underwater vehicles. Supposing the use of inspection cameras, this proposal is composed of two stages: i) the use of computer vision for visual odometry, extracting landmarks in underwater image sequences and ii) the development of topological maps for localization and navigation. The integration of such systems will allow visual odometry, localization and mapping of the environment. A set of tests with real robots was accomplished, regarding online and performance issues. The results reveals an accuracy and robust approach to several underwater conditions, as illumination and noise, leading to a promissory and original visual odometry and mapping technique.},

abstract = {This paper presents a SLAM-based approach for creating maps of underwater terrain using AUVs with poor inertial information. The initial motivating application for this work was mapping in the non-inertial frame of a free-drifting Antarctic iceberg, but poor inertial information can also occur if low-cost, high drift inertial instrumentation is used in standard mapping tasks, or if DVL bottom lock is lost during the mission. This paper presents a SLAM-based approach in which features are extracted from concatenated multibeam data and descriptors are created, allowing these features to be compared against past terrain as the vehicle traverses the area. There have been a number of previous research efforts that used feature-based SLAM techniques for underwater mapping, but they have generally made assumptions or relied on sensors that are inconsistent with this paper's motivating application, such as a flat bottom, the availability of visual imagery, or manmade fiducial markers. The method presented here uses natural terrain, is robust to water turbidity, and can be used in areas with vertical terrain like the walls of canyons and icebergs. Results are presented on data collected from Monterey Canyon using a vehicle with a high-grade IMU but that lost DVL bottom lock during the mapping run. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {This work proposes an improved unscented Kalman filter (UKF)-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm based on an adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) with a noise statistic estimator. The algorithm solves the issue that conventional UKF-SLAM algorithms have declining accuracy, with divergence occurring when the prior noise statistic is unknown and time-varying. The new SLAM algorithm performs an online estimation of the statistical parameters of unknown system noise by introducing a modified Sage-Husa noise statistic estimator. The algorithm also judges whether the filter is divergent and restrains potential filtering divergence using a covariance matching method. This approach reduces state estimation error, effectively improving navigation accuracy of the SLAM system. A line feature extraction is implemented through a Hough transform based on the ranging sonar model. Test results based on unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) sea trial data indicate that the proposed AUKF-SLAM algorithm is valid and feasible and provides better accuracy than the standard UKF-SLAM system.},

The algorithm extracts these chromaticity features at pixel level and therefore can perform well in scenes illuminated with non-uniform illuminant. An approach is proposed to use the algorithm with cameras of unknown sensitivity. The algorithm was tested for separability of perceptually similar colours under the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) standard illuminants and obtained a good performance. It was also tested for colour based object recognition by illuminating objects with typical indoor illuminants and obtained a better performance compared to other existing algorithms investigated in this paper. Finally, the algorithm was tested for skin detection invariant to illuminant, ethnic background and imaging device. In this investigation, daylight scenes under different weather conditions and scenes illuminated by typical indoor illuminants were used. The proposed algorithm gives a better skin detection performance compared to widely used standard colour spaces. Based on the results presented, the proposed illuminant invariant chromaticity space can be used for machine vision applications including illuminant invariant colour based object recognition and skin detection.},

abstract = { Abstract— Learning and then recognizing a route, whether travelled during the day or at night, in clear or inclement weather, and in summer or winter is a challenging task for state of the art algorithms in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we present a new approach to visual navigation under changing conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of calculating the single location most likely given a current image, our approach calculates the best candidate matching location within every local navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved by recognizing coherent sequences of these " local best matches " . This approach removes the need for global matching performance by the vision front-end – instead it must only pick the best match within any short sequence of images. The approach is applicable over environment changes that render traditional feature-based techniques ineffective. Using two car-mounted camera datasets we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and compare it to one of the most successful feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The perceptual change in the datasets is extreme; repeated traverses through environments during the day and then in the middle of the night, at times separated by months or years and in opposite seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy rain. While the feature-based method fails, the sequence-based algorithm is able to match trajectory segments at 100{\%} precision with recall rates of up to 60{\%}.},

abstract = {Map learning and self-localization based on perception of the environment's structure are fundamental capacities required for intelligent robots to realize true autonomy. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an effective technique for such robots, as it addresses the problem of incrementally building an environment map from noisy sensory data and tracking the robot's path with the built map. As a popular SLAM solution, FastSLAM suffers from limitation on error accumulation introduced by incorrect odometry model and inaccurate linearization of the SLAM nonlinear functions. To overcome the problem, a new Jacobian free neural network (NN) based FastSLAM algorithm is derived and discussed in this paper. The main contribution of the algorithm is twofold: on the one hand, the odometry error is online compensated by using a multilayer NN, and the NN is online trained during the SLAM process; on the other hand, the third-degree Cubature rule for Gaussian weighted integral, which calculates nonlinear transition density of Gaussian prior up to the 3rd order nonlinearity, is utilized to estimate the SLAM state (i.e., the robot path and environment map) and to online train the NN compensator. The performance of proposed SLAM is investigated and compared with that of popular FastSLAM2.0 in simulations and experiments. Results show that the proposed method improves the SLAM performance.},

We analyze and discuss the influence of several parameters such as the choice of the feature descriptor, the number of visual features, and validation methods. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our system can robustly deal with challenging scenarios such as fast cameras motions and feature-poor environments while being fast enough for online operation.

abstract = {Loop closure detection (LCD) is an indispensable part of simultaneous localization and mapping systems (SLAM); it enables robots to produce a consistent map by recognizing previously visited places. When robots operate over extended periods, robustness to viewpoint and condition changes as well as satisfactory real-time performance become essential requirements for a practical LCD system. This paper presents an approach to directly utilize the outputs at the intermediate layer of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as image descriptors. The matching location is determined by matching the image sequences through a method called SeqCNNSLAM. The utility of SeqCNNSLAM is comprehensively evaluated in terms of viewpoint and condition invariance. Experiments show that SeqCNNSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art LCD systems, such as SeqSLAM and Change Removal, in most cases. To allow for the real-time performance of SeqCNNSLAM, an acceleration method, A-SeqCNNSLAM, is established. This method exploits the location relationship between the matching images of adjacent images to reduce the matching range of the current image. Results demonstrate that acceleration of 4-6 is achieved with minimal accuracy degradation, and the method's runtime satisfies the real-time demand. To extend the applicability of A-SeqCNNSLAM to new environments, a method called O-SeqCNNSLAM is established for the online adjustment of the parameters of A-SeqCNNSLAM.},

Our system trains a convolutional neural network to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image in an end-to-end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation.

It obtains approximately 2m and 6 degree accuracy for large scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 10 degree accuracy indoors. This is achieved using an efficient 23 layer deep convnet, demonstrating that convnets can be used to solve complicated out of image plane regression problems. This was made possible by leveraging transfer learning from large scale classification data. We show the convnet localizes from high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and different camera intrinsics where point based SIFT registration fails. Furthermore we show how the pose feature that is produced generalizes to other scenes allowing us to regress pose with only a few dozen training examples.

abstract = {Combining visual and inertial measurements has become popular in mobile robotics, since the two sensing modalities offer complementary characteristics that make them the ideal choice for accurate visual–inertial odometry or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While historically the problem has been addressed with filtering, advancements in visual estimation suggest that nonlinear optimization offers superior accuracy, while still tractable in complexity thanks to the sparsity of the underlying problem. Taking inspiration from these findings, we formulate a rigorously probabilistic cost function that combines reprojection errors of landmarks and inertial terms. The problem is kept tractable and thus ensuring real-time operation by limiting the optimization to a bounded window of keyframes through marginalization. Keyframes may be spaced in time by arbitrary intervals, while still related by linearized inertial terms. We present evaluation results on complementary datasets recorded with our custom-built stereo visual–inertial hardware that accurately synchronizes accelerometer and gyroscope measurements with imagery. A comparison of both a stereo and monocular version of our algorithm with and without online extrinsics estimation is shown with respect to ground truth. Furthermore, we compare the performance to an implementation of a state-of-the-art stochastic cloning sliding-window filter. This competitive reference implementation performs tightly coupled filtering-based visual–inertial odometry. While our approach declaredly demands more computation, we show its superior performance in terms of accuracy.},

SLAM addresses the problem of con- structing an accurate map in real time despite imperfect information about the robot's trajectory through the en- vironment. Unlike other approaches that assume prede- termined landmarks (and must deal with a resulting data- association problem) our algorithm is purely laser based. Our algorithm uses a particle filter to represent both robot poses and possible map configurations. By using a new map representation, which we call distributed particle (DP) mapping, we are able to maintain and update hun- dreds of candidate maps and robot poses efficiently. The worst-case complexity of our algorithm per laser sweep is log-quadratic in the number of particles we maintain and linear in the area swept out by the laser. However, in practice our run time is usually much less than that.

Our system is capable of capturing comprehensive dense globally consistent surfel-based maps of room scale environments explored using an RGB-D camera in an incremental online fashion, without pose graph optimisation or any postprocessing steps. This is accomplished by using dense frame-tomodel camera tracking and windowed surfel-based fusion coupled with frequent model refinement through non-rigid surface deformations. Our approach applies local model-to-model surface loop closure optimisations as often as possible to stay close to the mode of the map distribution, while utilising global loop closure to recover from arbitrary drift and maintain global consistency},

abstract = {We propose a novel direct sparse visual odometry formulation. It combines a fully direct probabilistic model (minimizing a photometric error) with consistent, joint optimization of all model parameters, including geometry -- represented as inverse depth in a reference frame -- and camera motion. This is achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images. Since our method does not depend on keypoint detectors or descriptors, it can naturally sample pixels from across all image regions that have intensity gradient, including edges or smooth intensity variations on mostly white walls. The proposed model integrates a full photometric calibration, accounting for exposure time, lens vignetting, and non-linear response functions. We thoroughly evaluate our method on three different datasets comprising several hours of video. The experiments show that the presented approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art direct and indirect methods in a variety of real-world settings, both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.},

@article{Williams2010,
abstract = {Sequential monocular SLAM systems perform drift free tracking of the pose of a camera relative to a jointly estimated map of landmarks. To allow real-time operation in moderately sized environments, the map is kept quite spare with usually only tens of landmarks visible in each frame. In contrast, visual odometry techniques track hundreds of visual features per frame. This leads to a very accurate estimate of the relative camera motion, but without a persistent map, the estimate tends to drift over time. We demonstrate a new monocular SLAM system which combines the benefits of these two techniques. In addition to maintaining a sparse map of landmarks in the world, our system finds as many inter-frame point matches as possible. These point matches provide additional constraints on the inter-frame motion of the camera leading to a more accurate pose estimate, and, since they are not maintained as full map landmarks, they do not cause a large increase in the computational cost. Our results in both a simulated environment and in real video demonstrate the improvement in estimation accuracy gained by the inclusion of visual odometry style observations. The constraints available from pairwise point matches are most naturally cast in the context of a camera-centric rather than world-centric frame. To that end we recast the usual world-centric EKF implementation of visual SLAM in a robo-centric frame. We show that this robo-centric visual SLAM, as expected, leads to the estimated uncertainty more closely matching the ideal uncertainty; i.e., that robo-centric visual SLAM yields a more consistent estimate than the traditional world-centric EKF algorithm.},

@article{Alcantarilla,
abstract = {One of the main drawbacks of standard visual EKF-SLAM techniques is the assumption of a general camera motion model. Usually this motion model has been implemented in the literature as a constant linear and angular velocity model. Because of this, most approaches cannot deal with sudden camera movements, causing them to lose accurate camera pose and leading to a corrupted 3D scene map. In this work we propose increasing the robustness of EKF-SLAM techniques by replacing this general motion model with a visual odometry prior, which provides a real-time relative pose prior by tracking many hundreds of features from frame to frame. We perform fast pose estimation using the two-stage RANSAC-based approach from [1]: a two-point algorithm for rotation followed by a one-point algorithm for translation. Then we integrate the estimated relative pose into the prediction step of the EKF. In the measurement update step, we only incorporate a much smaller number of landmarks into the 3D map to maintain real-time operation. Incorporating the visual odometry prior in the EKF process yields better and more robust localization and mapping results when compared to the constant linear and angular velocity model case. Our experimental results, using a handheld stereo camera as the only sensor, clearly show the benefits of our method against the standard constant velocity model.},

A hybrid Bayesian/ frequentist formulation of the simultaneous planning, localization and mapping (SPLAM) problem is presented wherein the environment is modeled as a stationary, spatially uncorrelated random process whose stationary probabilities are fixed but unknown, and have to be estimated as the autonomous system moves through the environment and makes observations using its sensors. The environmental random process is estimated using stochastic approximation algorithms. Under a certain "reliable sensor assumption", it is shown that the mapping algorithms converge with probability one, and that the convergence of the mapping algorithms is independent of the planning policy, as long as it is non-anticipative, akin to the celebrated "Separation Principle" in Classical Linear Control theory. Further, the computational burden of the mapping algorithms is significantly reduced when compared to Bayesian SPLAM techniques.},

abstract = {Visual attention is the cognitive process that allows humans to parse a large amount of sensory data by selecting relevant information and filtering out irrelevant stimuli. This papers develops a computational framework for visual attention in robots. We consider a Visual Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem in which a robot needs to estimate its state using an on-board camera and an inertial sensor. The robot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to time and energy constraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under limited resources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the performance of visual-inertial navigation? Our approach has four key features. First, it is task-driven, in that the selection of the visual cues is guided by a metric quantifying the task performance. Second, it exploits the notion of anticipation, since it uses a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot dynamics, predicting the utility of a set of visual cues over a time horizon. Third, it is efficient and easy to implement, since it leads to a greedy algorithm for the selection of the most relevant visual cues. Fourth, it provides formal performance guarantees: we leverage submodularity to prove that the greedy selection cannot be far from the optimal (combinatorial) selection. Simulations and real experiments on agile drones show that our approach leads to dramatic improvements in the VIN performance. In the easy scenarios, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of localization errors. In the most challenging scenarios, it enables accurate visual-inertial navigation while the state of the art fails to track robot's motion during aggressive maneuvers.},

abstract = {This paper describes an on-line algorithm for multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The starting point is the single-robot Rao-Blackwellized particle filter described by Hahnel et al., and three key generalizations are made. First, the particle filter is extended to handle multi-robot SLAM problems in which the initial pose of the robots is known (such as occurs when all robots start from the same location). Second, an approximation is introduced to solve the more general problem in which the initial pose of robots is not known a priori (such as occurs when the robots start from widely separated locations). In this latter case, it is assumed that pairs of robots will eventually encounter one another, thereby determining their relative pose. This relative attitude is used to initialize the filter, and subsequent observations from both robots are combined into a common map. Third and finally, a method is introduced to integrate observations collected prior to the first robot encounter, using the notion of a virtual robot travelling backwards in time. This novel approach allows one to integrate all data from all robots into a single common map.},

abstract = {This article discusses the possibility of building in real-time a mosaic of the seafloor relying on a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. The goal is to provide an unmanned underwater vehicle with a relatively rough visual map of the seafloor to support basic navigation and context awareness. To achieve that goal, an accurate estimation of the location of the visual landmarks and, in particular, the correct data association when a visual landmark is re-visited by the vehicle are the crucial points. Instead of using a global mosaic, thiswork uses the combination of a set of local mosaics constructed in the vicinity of the SLAM visual landmarks. The contributions of this article are mainly the use of SURF features, the local mosaics approach and the real-time capability. The use of SURF features allows eliminating false positives in the data association of SLAM visual landmarks. The local mosaics approach is an effective way of correcting the effects of the drift on the mosaic in real time. The main contribution is the real-time capability as it will be seen. The algorithm was tested using a batch of experimental data in typical operating conditions and the results prove the effectiveness of the approach.},

Along with a monocular camera, our method uses a piecewise-planar model to explicitly optimize the ship hull surface in our factor-graph framework, and anchor nodes to co-register multiple surveys. To enable real- time performance for long-term SLAM, we use the recent Generic Linear Constraints (GLC) framework to sparsify our factor-graph. This paper analyzes how our single-session SLAM techniques can be used in the GLC framework, and describes a particle filter reacquisition algorithm so that an underwater session can be automatically re-localized to a previously built SLAM graph. We provide real-world experimental results involving automated ship hull inspection, and show that our lo- calization filter out-performs Fast Appearance-Based Mapping (FAB-MAP), a popular place-recognition system. Using our approach, we can automatically align surveys that were taken days, months, and even years apart.},

@article{Zhang2015a,
abstract = {We propose a real-time method for odometry and mapping using range measurements from a 2-axis lidar moving in 6-DOF. The problem is hard because the range measurements are received at different times, and errors in motion estimation can cause mis-registration of the resulting point cloud. To date, coherent 3D maps can be built by off-line batch methods, often using loop closure to correct for drift over time. Our method achieves both low-drift and low-computational complexity with- out the need for high accuracy ranging or inertial measurements. The key idea in obtaining this level of performance is the division of the complex problem of simultaneous localization and mapping, which seeks to optimize a large number of variables simultaneously, by two algorithms. One algorithm performs odometry at a high frequency but low fidelity to estimate velocity of the lidar. Another algorithm runs at a frequency of an order of magnitude lower for fine matching and registration of the point cloud. Combination of the two algorithms allows the method to map in real-time. The method has been evaluated by a large set of experiments as well as on the KITTI odometry benchmark. The results indicate that the method can achieve accuracy at the level of state of the art offline batch methods.},

Alongside these advances, visual mapping has become a very active research area, which facilitates the mapping of areas inaccessible to humans. This requires the efficient processing of data to increase the final mosaic quality and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient image mosaicing algorithm for large area visual mapping in underwater environments using multiple underwater robots. Our method identifies overlapping image pairs in the trajectories carried out by the different robots during the topology estimation process, being this a cornerstone for efficiently mapping large areas of the seafloor.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.In this paper, we present an iterative two-stage scheme for precise and robust frame-To-frame feature-based ego-motion estimation using stereo cameras. We analyze the characteristics of the optical flows and reprojection errors that are independently induced by each of the decoupled six degrees of freedom motion. As we will show, the different characteristics of these induced optical flows lead to a reprojection error that depends on the coordinates of the features. When using a proper normalization of the reprojection error, this coordinatedependency can be almost completely removed for decoupled motions. Furthermore, we present a way to use these results for automotive application where rotation and forward motion are coupled. This is done by compensating for the flow that is induced by the rotation, which decouples the translation flow from the overall flow. The resulting method generalizes the ROCC approach [4], where a robust outlier criterion was introduced and proved to increase robustness and quality for large forward translation motions. Therewith the proposed method generalizes ROCC to almost all possible automotive motions. The performance of the method is evaluated on Kitti benchmark and currently2 reaches the best translation error of all camera-based methods.},

abstract = {After the incredible success of deep learning in the computer vision domain, there has been much interest in applying Convolutional Network (ConvNet) features in robotic fields such as visual navigation and SLAM. Unfortunately, there are fundamental differences and challenges involved. Computer vision datasets are very different in character to robotic camera data, real-time performance is essential, and performance priorities can be different. This paper comprehensively evaluates and compares the utility of three state-of-the-art ConvNets on the problems of particular relevance to navigation for robots; viewpoint-invariance and condition-invariance, and for the first time enables real-time place recognition performance using ConvNets with large maps by integrating a variety of existing (locality-sensitive hashing) and novel (semantic search space partitioning) optimization techniques. We present extensive experiments on four real world datasets cultivated to evaluate each of the specific challenges in place recognition. The results demonstrate that speed-ups of two orders of magnitude can be achieved with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling real-time performance. We confirm that networks trained for semantic place categorization also perform better at (specific) place recognition when faced with severe appearance changes and provide a reference for which networks and layers are optimal for different aspects of the place recognition problem.},

abstract = {In this work we present a novel algorithm for realtime visual odometry for a monocular camera. The main idea is to develop an approach between classical feature-based vi-sual odometry systems and modern direct dense/semi-dense methods, trying to benefit from the best attributes of both. Similar to feature-based systems, we extract information from the images, instead of working with raw image inten-sities as direct methods. In particular, the information ex-tracted are the edges present in the image, while the rest of the algorithm is designed to take advantage of the struc-tural information provided when pixels are treated as edges. Edge extraction is an efficient and higly parallelizable op-eration. The edge depth information extracted is dense enough to allow acceptable surface fitting, similar to mod-ern semi-dense methods. This is a valuable attribute that feature-based odometry lacks. Experimental results show that the proposed method has similar drift than state of the art feature-based and direct methods, and is a simple algo-rithm that runs at realtime and can be parallelized. Finally, we have also developed an inertial aided version that suc-cessfully stabilizes an unmanned air vehicle in complex in-door environments using only a frontal camera, while run-ning the complete solution in the embedded hardware on board the vehicle.},

Besides serving the activities of inspection and mapping, the captured images can also be used to aid navigation and localization of the robots. Visual odometry is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images. It has been used in a wide variety of non-standard locomotion robotic methods. In this context, this paper proposes an approach to visual odometry and mapping of underwater vehicles. Supposing the use of inspection cameras, this proposal is composed of two stages: i) the use of computer vision for visual odometry, extracting landmarks in underwater image sequences and ii) the development of topological maps for localization and navigation. The integration of such systems will allow visual odometry, localization and mapping of the environment. A set of tests with real robots was accomplished, regarding online and performance issues. The results reveals an accuracy and robust approach to several underwater conditions, as illumination and noise, leading to a promissory and original visual odometry and mapping technique.},

We use the hundreds of images available in a video stream to improve the quality of a simple photometric data term, and minimise a global spatially regularised energy functional in a novel non-convex optimisation framework. Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and DTAM achieves real-time performance using current commodity GPU hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

abstract = {Recent research concerning the Gaussian canonical form for Simulta- neous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has given rise to a handful of algorithms that attempt to solve the SLAM scalability problem for arbitrarily large environments. One such estimator that has received due attention is the Sparse Extended Information Filter (SEIF) pro- posed by Thrun et al., which is reported to be nearly constant time, ir- respective of the size of the map. The key to the SEIF's scalability is to prune weak links in what is a dense information (inverse covariance) matrix to achieve a sparse approximation that allows for efficient, scalable SLAM. We demonstrate that the SEIF sparsification strat- egy yields error estimates that are overconfident when expressed in the global reference frame, while empirical results show that relative map consistency is maintained.$\backslash$nIn this paper, we propose an alternative scalable estimator based on an information form that maintains sparsity while preserving con- sistency. The paper describes a method for controlling the population of the information matrix, whereby we track a modified version of the SLAM posterior, essentially by ignoring a small fraction of temporal measurements. In this manner, the Exactly Sparse Extended Informa- tion Filter (ESEIF) performs inference over a model that is conserv- ative relative to the standard Gaussian distribution. We compare our algorithm to the SEIF and standard EKF both in simulation as well as on two nonlinear datasets. The results convincingly show that our method yields conservative estimates for the robot pose and map that are nearly identical to those of the EKF.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the extended Kalman filter formulation of simultaneous localisation and mapping (EKF-SLAM). We show that the algorithm produces very optimistic estimates once the "true" uncertainty in vehicle heading exceeds a limit. This failure is subtle and cannot, in general, be detected without ground-truth, although a very inconsistent filter may exhibit observable symptoms, such as disproportionately large jumps in the vehicle pose update. Conventional solutions - adding stabilising noise, using an iterated EKF or unscented filter, etc., - do not improve the situation. However, if "small" heading uncertainty is maintained, EKF-SLAM exhibits consistent behaviour over an extended time-period. Although the uncertainty estimate slowly becomes optimistic, inconsistency can be mitigated indefinitely by applying tactics such as batch updates or stabilising noise. The manageable degradation of small heading variance SLAM indicates the efficacy of submap methods for large-scale maps},

abstract = {The Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) designed at the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Canterbury is in an early stage of development. With the design of the AUV completed, the primary focus now is to design control software. The control software has to be able to stabilize the vehicle at a desired position and let the vehicle follow a desired trajectory within a reasonable error. The AUV is able to operate in six degrees of freedom and the dynamics of an AUV are nonlinear and subjected to a variety of disturbances. A kinematic and dynamic model of the AUV is derived for the six degrees of freedom operating range. The degrees of freedom are decoupled, where only the surge, heave and yaw degrees of freedom will be controlled. A system identification approach is proposed to estimate unknown mass/inertia and damping parameters, treating the surge, heave and yaw degrees of freedom separately. Unfortunately due to sensor malfunctioning the unknown mass/inertia and damping terms could not be estimated, a parameter selection method is used instead. The parameter selection is based on parameter estimation results of software programs and a parameter comparison with other similar shaped AUVs. A feedback linearizing control technique is chosen to design control laws for control in the surge, heave and yaw degrees of freedom. The controller performed well under parameter perturbation and noise contamination on the feedback position and velocity signals. An under-actuated control problem arises in x-y plane, since one is only able to control two degrees of freedom while the AUV has three degrees of freedom. To steer the AUV smoothly, a path planning model is derived, which describes a path from A to B with the use of polar coordinates. It works as expected, except for planning a straight line trajectory due to singularity reasons. iv The under-actuated control problem is again investigated, assuming sway motion of the AUV is not negligible, so Coriolis and centripetal forces need to be considered. A state feedback control method is explained, which is able to follow a reference trajectory in the x-y plane. The only disadvantage is that the yaw degree of freedom of the reference trajectory needs to be persistently exciting, which makes following a straight line impossible.},

A probabilistic depth measurement is carried out in real time on a per-pixel basis and the computed uncertainty is used to reject erroneous estimations and provide live feedback on the reconstruction progress. Our contribution is a novel approach to depth map computation that combines Bayesian estimation and recent development on convex optimization for image processing.We demonstrate that our method outperforms state- of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, while exhibiting high efficiency in memory usage and computing power.

Like much recent work on appearance based navigation we adopt a bag-of-words approach in which positive or negative observations of visual words in a scene are used to discriminate between already visited and new places. In this paper we add an important extra dimension to the approach. We explicitly model the spatial distribution of visual words as a random graph in which nodes are visual words and edges are distributions over distances. Care is taken to ensure that the spatial model is able to capture the multi-modal distributions of inter-word spacing and account for sensor errors both in word detection and distances. Crucially, these inter-word distances are viewpoint invariant and collectively constitute strong place signatures and hence the impact of using both spatial and visual appearance is marked. We provide results illustrating a tremendous increase in precision-recall area compared to a state-of-the-art visual appearance only systems.},

abstract = {Real-time, high-quality, 3D scanning of large-scale scenes is key to mixed reality and robotic applications. However, scalability brings challenges of drift in pose estimation, introducing significant errors in the accumulated model. Approaches often require hours of offline processing to globally correct model errors. Recent online methods demonstrate compelling results, but suffer from: (1) needing minutes to perform online correction preventing true real-time use; (2) brittle frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation resulting in many tracking failures; or (3) supporting only unstructured point-based representations, which limit scan quality and applicability. We systematically address these issues with a novel, real-time, end-to-end reconstruction framework. At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy, optimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the complete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach. We remove the heavy reliance on temporal tracking, and continually localize to the globally optimized frames instead. We contribute a parallelizable optimization framework, which employs correspondences based on sparse features and dense geometric and photometric matching. Our approach estimates globally optimized (i.e., bundle adjusted) poses in real-time, supports robust tracking with recovery from gross tracking failures (i.e., relocalization), and re-estimates the 3D model in real-time to ensure global consistency; all within a single framework. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online systems with quality on par to offline methods, but with unprecedented speed and scan completeness. Our framework leads to a comprehensive online scanning solution for large indoor environments, enabling ease of use and high-quality results.},

The system we present is not limited to localization, but can determine that a new observation comes from a previously unseen place, and so augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM system in the space of appearance. Our probabilistic approach allows us to explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the environment--identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having come from the same place. We achieve this by learning a generative model of place appearance. By partitioning the learning problem into two parts, new place models can be learned online from only a single observation of a place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of places in the map, and is particularly suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.},

@article{Kim2012,
abstract = {One of the major challenges in the field of underwater robotics is the opacity of the water medium to radio frequency transmission modes, which precludes the use of a global positioning system (GPS) and high speed radio communication in underwater navigation and mapping applications. One approach to underwater robotics that overcomes this limitation is vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), a framework that enables a robot to localize itself, while simultaneously building a map of an unknown environment. The SLAM algorithm provides a probabilistic map that contains the estimated state of the system, including a map of the environment and the pose of the robot. Because the quality of vision-based navigation varies spatially within the environment the performance of visual SLAM strongly depends on the path and motion that the robot follows. While traditionally treated as two separate problems, SLAM and path planning are indeed interrelated: the performance of SLAM depends significantly on the environment and motion; however, control of the robot motion fully depends on the information from SLAM. Therefore, an integrated SLAM control scheme is needed?one that can direct motion for better localization and mapping, and thereby provide more accurate state information back to the controller. This thesis develops perception-driven control, an integrated SLAM and path planning framework that improves the performance of visual SLAM in an informative and efficient way by jointly considering the reward predicted by a candidate camera measurement, along with its likelihood of success based upon visual saliency. The proposed control architecture identifies highly informative candidate locations for SLAM loop-closure that are also visually distinctive, such that a camera-derived pose-constraint is probable. Results are shown for autonomous underwater hull inspection experiments using the Bluefin Robotics Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV).},

We show that it is possible to estimate both state and parameters as part of an on-line procedure, but only provided that the motion sequence is “rich enough,” a condition that we characterize explicitly. We then describe an efficient implementation of a filter to estimate the state and parameters of this model, including gravity and camera-to-inertial calibration. It runs in real-time on an embedded platform, and its performance has been tested extensively. We report experiments of continuous operation, without failures, re-initialization, or re-calibration, on paths of length up to 30Km. We also describe an integrated approach to “loop-closure,” that is the recognition of previously-seen locations and the topological re-adjustment of the traveled path. It represents visual features relative to the global orientation reference provided by the gravity vector estimated by the filter, and relative to the scale provided by their known position within the map; these features are organized into “locations” defined by visibility constraints, represented in a topological graph, where loop closure can be performed without the need to re-compute past trajectories or perform bundle adjustment. The software infrastructure as well as the embedded platform is described in detail in a technical report (Jones and Soatto (2009).)},

abstract = {Visual odometry is an important research prob- lem for computer vision and robotics. In general, the feature-based visual odometry methods heavily rely on the accurate correspondences between lo- cal salient points, while the direct approaches could make full use of whole image and perform dense 3D reconstruction simultaneously. However, the di- rect visual odometry usually suffers from the draw- back of getting stuck at local optimum especially with large displacement, which may lead to the in- ferior results. To tackle this critical problem, we propose a novel scheme for stereo odometry in this paper, which is able to improve the convergence with more accurate pose. The key of our approach is a dual Jacobian optimization that is fused into a multi-scale pyramid scheme. Moreover, we intro- duce a gradient-based feature representation, which enjoys the merit of being robust to illumination changes. Furthermore, a joint direct odometry ap- proach is proposed to incorporate the information from the last frame and previous keyframes. We have conducted the experimental evaluation on the challenging KITTI odometry benchmark, whose promising results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective for stereo visual odometry. 1},

abstract = {Visual inspection of underwater structures including ship-hull inspection has been performed by human divers. It is a highly dangerous task and thus can be a potential application for unmanned underwater vehicles. This paper introduces an efficient visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that can be applied to the autonomous inspection of underwater structures. Considering that visual features are sparsely located on the surface of typical underwater structures, the proposed visual SLAM algorithm employs a selective image registration scheme consisting of key-frame selection and keypair selection. By using only potentially effective images and image pairs for feature-based image registration, the computational burden of the visual SLAM can be substantially reduced, compared with the conventional method. Experimental results using a hover-capable unmanned underwater vehicle verify the practical feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology.},

Our fusion scheme privileges depth prediction in image locations where monocular SLAM approaches tend to fail, e.g. along low-textured regions, and vice-versa. We demonstrate the use of depth prediction for estimating the absolute scale of the reconstruction, hence overcoming one of the major limitations of monocular SLAM.

Specifically we focus on the related problems of Structure from Motion and Visually Based Navigation from underwater optical imagery assuming pose instrumented calibrated cameras. We present general wide baseline solutions for these problems based on the extension of techniques from the SLAM, photogrammetric and the computer vision communities. We also examine how such techniques can be extended for the very different sensing modality and scale associated with multi-beam bathymetric mapping.

This paper proposes a Range-Only scheme based on Sparse Extended Information Filters (SEIF) that efficiently exploits their capabilities. The robot computes the SLAM prediction stage and distributes the update stage among beacons within its sensing area. The proposed scheme naturally integrates robot-beacon and inter-beacon measurements, significantly improving map and also robot estimations.

As a result, it has lower error and lower computer requirements than traditional methods. This paper presents the scheme, evaluates and compares its performance in simulations and real experiments.},

However when employed in complex 3D environments, they typically suffer from challenges related to partial observability, combinatorial exploration spaces, path planning, and a scarcity of rewarding scenarios. Inspired from prior work in human cognition that indicates how humans employ a variety of semantic concepts and abstractions (object categories, localisation, etc.) to reason about the world, we build an agent-model that incorporates such abstractions into its policy-learning framework. We augment the raw image input to a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN), by adding details of objects and structural elements encountered, along with the agent's localisation. The different components are automatically extracted and composed into a topological representation using on-the-fly object detection and 3D-scene reconstruction.We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in Doom, a 3D first-person combat game that exhibits a number of challenges discussed, and show that our augmented framework consistently learns better, more effective policies.},

We analyze the performance of the proposed robotic implementation operating in the real world. We conclude that the biomimetic navigation model operating on the information from the biomimetic sonar allows an autonomous agent to map unmodified (office) environments efficiently and consistently. Furthermore, these results also show that successful navigation does not require the readings of the biomimetic sonar to be interpreted in terms of individual objects/landmarks in the environment.

Our approach uses a tree-structured Bayesian representation of map posteriors that makes it possible to revise data association decisions arbitrarily far into the past. We describe a criterion for detecting and repairing poor data association decisions. This technique makes it possible to acquire maps of large-scale environments with many loops, with a minimum of computational overhead for the management of multiple data association hypotheses. A empirical comparison with the popular FastSLAM algorithm shows the advantage of lazy over proactive data association.},

abstract = {We propose a fundamentally novel approach to real-time visual odometry for a monocular camera. It allows to ben- efit from the simplicity and accuracy of dense tracking – which does not depend on visual features – while running in real-time on a CPU. The key idea is to continuously estimate a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current frame, which in turn is used to track the motion of the camera using dense image alignment. More specifically, we estimate the depth of all pixels which have a non-negligible image gradient. Each estimate is represented as a Gaussian probability distribution over the inverse depth. We propagate this information over time, and update it with new measurements as new images arrive. In terms of tracking accuracy and computational speed, the proposed method compares favorably to both state-of-the-art dense and feature-based visual odometry and SLAM algorithms. As our method runs in real-time on a CPU, it is of large practical value for robotics and augmented reality applications. 1.Towards},

To obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives of the vehicle and the dynamical models of the thruster and fins, a series of hydrodynamic experiments are conducted by using vertical planar motion mechanism (PMM) and circulating water channel (CWC). Maneuvering simulation is carried out by using the hydrodynamic model obtained from experiments, and SVM is applied to identify the damping terms together with Coriolis and centripetal terms by analyzing the simulation data. By using the identified nonlinear model and experiment-based hydrodynamic model respectively, maneuvering simulations and control applications are implemented.

abstract = {— While the most accurate solution to off-line struc-ture from motion (SFM) problems is undoubtedly to extract as much correspondence information as possible and perform global optimisation, sequential methods suitable for live video streams must approximate this to fit within fixed computational bounds. Two quite different approaches to real-time SFM — also called monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) — have proven successful, but they sparsify the problem in different ways. Filtering methods marginalise out past poses and summarise the information gained over time with a probability distribution. Keyframe methods retain the optimisation approach of global bundle adjustment, but computationally must select only a small number of past frames to process. In this paper we perform the first rigorous analysis of the relative advantages of filtering and sparse optimisation for sequential monocular SLAM. A series of experiments in simulation as well using a real image SLAM system were performed by means of covariance propagation and Monte Carlo methods, and comparisons made using a combined cost/accuracy measure. With some well-discussed reservations, we conclude that while filtering may have a niche in systems with low processing resources, in most modern applications keyframe optimisation gives the most accuracy per unit of computing time.},

abstract = {Modelling and control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) pose serious challenges due to their complex, inherently nonlinear and time-varying dynamics. Thus there is a necessity for designing a robust and stable control system that would selftune the system when the performance degrades during the operation. Due to the complexities associated with the AUV dynamics, a black box identification technique is used for modelling the behaviour of the AUV. To improve online identification in the presence of noisy data, this thesis introduces a novel identifier scheme for identification of non-linear systems with disturbances, that we call semi serial-parallel model (SSPM). The model based controller and the identification model of the UNSW@ADFA AUV are developed using the offline and online techniques and are based upon Fuzzy system and Hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy Network techniques. A novel auto-generating mechanism with entropy based Differential Evolution (DE) system modelling is proposed to generate the AUV model without any prior knowledge of the physical relationship inside the system or its behaviour. It is carried out in two steps; an off-line procedure and an on-line procedure. The method comprises of an automatic structure generating phase using entropy based technique and a parameter-learning phase. The accuracy of the model is suitably controlled using the entropy measure. The parameter learning phase uses the back-propagation technique. To improve the accuracy and also for generalization of the model to handle different data sets, DE technique is employed whereby the parameters of the model are suitably tuned using evolutionary technique. A number of benchmark problems are considered to validate the methodology and the accuracy of the results from the proposed method are found to be superior compared with the existing techniques. The proposed mechanism is used to design the control system. These techniques need to be real time implementable. Real time validations using Hardware In Loop (HIL) simulations show that both identification methods are feasible for control. The accuracy of identification using online auto-generating mechanism is better than the offline technique in terms of accuracy and computational time. HIL simulations applied to simulate the performance of the developed control system of surge, pitch and yaw movements. Finally, real time experiments of the proposed algorithm for identifying the AUV dynamics are implemented. The experimental results show that the proposed identification mechanism and the model adaptive controller are capable of controlling the AUV suitably in a real environment, demonstrating its robustness characteristics.},

Central to this work is the use of an "as-rigid-as-possible" space deformation for efficient dense map correction in a pose graph optimisation framework. By combining pose graph optimisation with non-rigid deformation of a dense map we are able to obtain highly accurate dense maps over large scale trajectories that are both locally and globally consistent. With low latency in mind we derive an incremental method for deformation graph construction, allowing multi-million point maps to be captured over hundreds of metres in real-time.

@article{Thrun2008,
abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive introduction into the simultaneous localization and mapping problem, better known in its abbreviated form as SLAM. SLAM addresses the problem of a robot navigating an unknown environment. While navigating the environment, the robot seeks to acquire a map thereof, and at the same time it wishes to localize itself using its map. The use of SLAM problems can be motivated in two different ways. One might be interested in detailed environment models, or one might seek to maintain an accurate sense of a mobile robot's location. SLAM servers both of these purposes. We review three major paradigms of algorithms from which a huge number of recently published methods are derived. First comes the traditional approach, which relies in the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for representing the robot's best estimate. The second paradigm draws its intuition from the fact that the SLAM problem can be viewed as a sparse graph of constraints, and it applies nonlinear optimization for recovering the map and the robot's locations. Finally, we survey the particle filter paradigm, which applies non-parametric density estimation and efficient factorization methods to the SLAM problem. This article discusses extensions of these basic methods. 11, elucidates variants of the SLAM problem and poses a taxonomy for the field. Relevant research is referenced extensively, and open research problems are discussed.},

This is in contrast to state-of-the-art methods that are O(n 5) or even O(n 8), without being more accurate. Our method is applicable for all n≥4 and handles properly both planar and non-planar configurations. Our central idea is to express the n 3D points as a weighted sum of four virtual control points. The problem then reduces to estimating the coordinates of these control points in the camera referential, which can be done in O(n) time by expressing these coordinates as weighted sum of the eigenvectors of a 12×12 matrix and solving a small constant number of quadratic equations to pick the right weights. Furthermore, if maximal precision is required, the output of the closed-form solution can be used to initialize a Gauss-Newton scheme, which improves accuracy with negligible amount of additional time. The advantages of our method are demonstrated by thorough testing on both synthetic and real-data.},

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms attempt to fuse these estimates to produce a map and a robot trajectory.

The optimization can be difficult, due to poor initial estimates arising from odometry data, and due to the size of the state space. We present a fast non-linear optimization algorithm that rapidly recovers the robot trajectory, even when given a poor initial estimate.

Our method utilises revised measurements model linearisation and decision making to detect and remove outliers during data fusion. We utilise innovations and residuals gating to decide which observations were affected, given the most recent model linearisation point. By exploiting the inherited locality of measurements and states and the sparsity structure of nonlinear least-squares formulation we can check which measurement is affected before and after data fusion. This locality is the whole basis of robustification. To be efficient, we carry out the estimation using the information form. By doing so, we can include and remove information by individual measurements at each step using simple information addition and subtraction operations. Our results demonstrate the robustness of our method against outliers with respect to the use of kinematics alone and RANSAC with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.},

abstract = {A minimal synaptic architecture is proposed for how the brain might perform path integration by computing the next internal representation of self-location from the current representation and from the perceived velocity of motion. In the model, a place-cell assembly called a "chart" contains a two-dimensional attractor set called an "attractor map" that can be used to represent coordinates in any arbitrary environment, once associative binding has occurred between chart locations and sensory inputs. In hippocampus, there are different spatial relations among place fields in different environments and behavioral contexts. Thus, the same units may participate in many charts, and it is shown that the number of uncorrelated charts that can be encoded in the same recurrent network is potentially quite large. According to this theory, the firing of a given place cell is primarily a cooperative effect of the activity of its neighbors on the currently active chart. Therefore, it is not particularly useful to think of place cells as encoding any particular external object or event. Because of its recurrent connections, hippocampal field CA3 is proposed as a possible location for this "multichart" architecture; however, other implementations in anatomy would not invalidate the main concepts. The model is implemented numerically both as a network of integrate-and-fire units and as a "macroscopic" (with respect to the space of states) description of the system, based on a continuous approximation defined by a system of stochastic differential equations. It provides an explanation for a number of hitherto perplexing observations on hippocampal place fields, including doubling, vanishing, reshaping in distorted environments, acquiring directionality in a two-goal shuttling task, rapid formation in a novel environment, and slow rotation after disorientation. The model makes several new predictions about the expected properties of hippocampal place cells and other cells of the proposed network.},

Such changes are especially likely to occur for loop closures in SLAM. Alternatives exist which attempt to match images more robustly. In our paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of real-time capable methods. We determine their accuracy and robustness in the context of odometry and of loop closures, both on real images as well as synthetic datasets with simulated lighting changes. We find that for real images, a Census-based method outperforms the others. We make our new datasets available online 3 .},

abstract = {Remotely operated, underwater robotic vehicles have become the important tool to explore the secrete life undersea. They are used for various purposes: inspection, recovery, construction, etc. With the increased utilization of remotely operated vehicles in subsea applica- tions, the development of autonomous vehicles becomes highly desirable to enhance operator efficiency. However, engineering problems associ- ated with the high density, nonuniform and unstructured seawater environment, and the nonlinear response of the vehicle make a high degree of autonomy difficult to achieve. The dynamic model of the untethered vehicle is presented, and an adaptive control strategy for such vehicles is described. The robustness of the control system with respect to the nonlinear dynamic behavior and parameter uncertainties is investigated by computer simulation. The results show that the use of the adaptive control system can provide the high performance of the vehicle in the presence of unpredictable changes in the dynamics of the vehicle and its environment.},

abstract = {The Extend Kalman Filter based algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping cannot satisfy the requirement of real time map updating because of the increasing number of landmarks and the heavy calculating cost while AUV working for long time endurance. The Compressed EKF based SLAM is introduced in this paper. And the method of map management and the local map switch strategy are addressed, which divide the AUV navigating area into several local sub-maps. The navigation error calculating based on landmarks in sub-map is completed in local area by using Extend Kalman filter, and the global map updating is done only when the condition satisfied the switch rule of the sub-map. Finally the CEKF-SLAM based navigating method is tested with the trial data, and by comparing with the dead reckoning navigating result, the test results show that the navigation error of CEKF-SLAM algorithm is less than that of dead reckoning algorithm, and on the same time, the former reduces the calculation cost for AUV navigation.},

abstract = {This paper addresses two key limitations of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) when applied to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem: the cubic, in the number of states, computational complexity, and the inconsistency of the state estimates. In particular, we introduce a new sampling strategy that minimizes the linearization error and whose computational complexity is constant (i.e., independent of the size of the state vector). As a result, the overall computational complexity of UKF-based SLAM becomes of the same order as that of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) when applied to SLAM. Furthermore, we investigate the observability properties of the linear-regression-based model employed by the UKF, and propose a new algorithm, termed the observability-constrained (OC)-UKF, that improves the consistency of the state estimates. The superior performance of the OC-UKF compared to the standard UKF and its robustness to large linearization errors are validated by extensive simulations.},

abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles are currently being utilised for scientific, commercial and military underwater applications. These vehicles require autonomous guidance and control systems in order to perform underwater tasks. Modelling, system identification and control of these vehicles are still major active areas of research and development. This thesis is concerned with the design and development of an AUV specifically in- tended for entry into international underwater vehicle competitions. The thesis consists of two phases; the first involves the design and construction of the vehicle while the second phase is concerned with the modelling and system identification of the vehicle, as well as the simulation of a control system. The design and development of the vehicle consisted of implementing a mechanical and electrical system, as well as the integration of subsystems. The development of these systems has resulted in a low-speed, bottom-heavy, open-frame underwater vehicle named the Mako that exhibits high symmetry, modularity and stability. The modelling of the Mako was then performed which involved the application of the dynamic model of an underwater vehicle and the consequent identification of the relevant parameters. The systemidentification of the vehicle parameters consisted of using onboard sensors to perform static and dynamic experiments. Least squares estimation was used to estimate the parameters from the experimental data obtained. For the control system of the Mako, a PID tracking controller based on computed torque control was adopted. The controller was applied to the vehicle's dynamics and simulated using the parameters found in the system identification process. The results of the simulations demonstrate that this type of controller could indeed be successfully implemented on the vehicle. The undertakings in this thesis have resulted in a functioning autonomous underwater vehicle that has undergone modelling, system identification and preliminary control analy- sis. The groundwork has indeed been laid for the Mako's entry into future underwater competitions.},

Several open source packages have appeared addressing the problem, each supported by im- pressive demonstrations. Applying any of these packages on a new dataset however, has been proven extremely challenging. Suboptimal perfor- mance, loss of localization, and challenges in customization have not produced a clear winner. Several other research groups have presented superb performance without releasing the code, sometimes materializing as commercial products. In this paper, ten of the most promising open source packages are evaluated, by cross validating them on the datasets provided for each package and by testing them on eight different datasets collected over the years in our laboratory. Indoor and outdoor, terrestrial and flying vehicles, in addition to underwater robots, cameras, and buoys were used to collect data. An analysis on the motions required for the different approaches and an evaluation of their performance is presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel vision-based sensory package and an information-efficient simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Together, we offer a solution for building 3-D dense map in an unknown and unstructured environment with minimal computational costs. The sensory package we adopt consists of a conventional camera and a range imager, which provide range and bearing and elevation inputs as commonly used by 3-D feature-based SLAM. In addition, we propose an algorithm to give the robots the `intelligencerdquo to select, out of the steadily collected data, the maximally informative observations to be used in the estimation process. We show that, although the actual evaluation of information gain for each frame introduces an additional computational cost, the overall efficiency is significantly increased by keeping the matrix compact. The noticeable advantage of this strategy is that the continuously gathered data are not heuristically segmented prior to being input to the filter. Quite the opposite, the scheme lends itself to be statistically optimal and is capable of handling large datasets collected at realistic sampling rates.},

The 1,000km experiment is more than an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported result. The scalability of the system is achieved by defining a sparse approximation to the FAB-MAP model suitable for implementation using an inverted index. Our formulation of the problem is fully probabilistic and naturally incorporates robustness against perceptual aliasing.

abstract = {— Loop closure detection or place recognition is a fundamental problem in robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). SeqSLAM is considered to be one of the most successful algorithms for loop closure detection as it has been demonstrated to be able to handle significant environmental condition changes including those due to illumination, weather, and time of the day. However, SeqSLAM relies heavily on exhaustive sequence matching, a computationally expensive process that prevents the algorithm from being used in dealing with large maps. In this paper, we propose Fast-SeqSLAM, an efficient version of SeqSLAM. Fast-SeqSLAM has a much reduced time complexity without degrading the accuracy, and this is achieved by using an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm to match the current image with those in the robot map and extending the idea of SeqSLAM to greedily search a sequence of images that best match with the current sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Fast-SeqSLAM algorithm in appearance based loop closure detection.},

However, such depth information can be limited by the sensors, leaving large areas in the visual images where depth is unavailable. Here, we propose a method to utilize the depth, even if sparsely available, in recovery of camera motion. In addition, the method utilizes depth by triangulation from the previously estimated motion, and salient visual features for which depth is unavailable. The core of our method is a bundle adjustment that refines the motion estimates in parallel by processing a sequence of images, in a batch optimization. We have evaluated our method in three sensor setups, one using an RGB-D camera, and two using combinations of a camera and a 3D lidar. Our method is rated 2 on the KITTI odometry benchmark irrespective of sensing modality, and is rated 1 among visual odometry methods.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

We formulate the localization problem as inference in a Markov random field, which jointly reasons about text detection (localizing shop's names in the image with precise bounding boxes), shop facade segmentation, as well as camera's rotation and translation within the entire shopping mall. The power of our approach is that it does not use any prior information about appearance and instead exploits text detections corresponding to the shop names. This makes our method applicable to a variety of domains and robust to store appearance variation across countries, seasons, and illumination conditions. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in a new dataset we collected of two very large shopping malls, and show the power of holistic reasoning.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an outlier removal scheme for stereo-based visual odometry which is especially suited for improving high-speed pose change estimations in large-scale depth environments. First we investigate the vari- ance of the reprojection error on the 3D position of a feature given a fixed error in pose change to conclude that a detection of outliers based on a fixed threshold on the reprojection error is inappropriate. Then we propose an optical flow dependent feature-adaptive scaling of the reprojection error to reach almost invariance to the 3D position of each feature. This feature-adaptive scaling is derived from an approximation showing the relation between longitudinal pose change of the camera, absolute value of the optical flow, and distance of the feature. Using this scaling, we develop an iterative alternating scheme to guide the separation of inliers from outliers. It optimizes the tradeoff between finding a good criterion to remove outliers based on a given pose change and improving the pose change hypothesis based on the current set of inliers. Including the new outlier removal scheme into a pure two-frame stereo-based visual odometry pipeline without applying bundle adjustment or SLAM-filtering we are currently ranked amongst the top camera-based algorithms and furthermore outperform camera and laser scanner methods in Kitti benchmark's high- speed scenarios.},

Compared to the well-known Octree representation, our approach exhibits a better time efficiency, thanks to its simple and highly parallelizable computational structure, and a similar memory footprint when mapping large workspaces.

abstract = {We present a system for accurate real-time mapping of complex and arbitrary indoor scenes in variable lighting conditions, using only a moving low-cost depth camera and commodity graphics hardware. We fuse all of the depth data streamed from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.},

This is achieved through (i) altering the original algorithm such that the region of space being mapped by the KinectFusion algorithm can vary dynamically, (ii) extracting a dense point cloud from the regions that leave the KinectFusion volume due to this variation, and, (iii) incrementally adding the resulting points to a triangular mesh representation of the environment. The system is implemented as a set of hierarchical multi-threaded components which are capable of operating in real-time. The architecture facilitates the creation and integration of new modules with minimal impact on the performance on the dense volume tracking and surface reconstruction modules. We provide experimental results demonstrating the system's ability to map areas considerably beyond the scale of the original KinectFusion algorithm including a two story apartment and an extended sequence taken from a car at night. In order to overcome failure of the iterative closest point (ICP) based odometry in areas of low geometric features we have evaluated the Fast Odometry from Vision (FOVIS) system as an alternative. We provide a comparison between the two approaches where we show a trade off between the reduced drift of the visual odometry approach and the higher local mesh quality of the ICP-based approach.

As each relative rigid-body motion is typically the product of statistical inference, the integrated absolute pose will exhibit error build-up and the estimated trajectory will differ from the true trajectory undertaken by the system. Some application areas allow the system to receive additional information about its current absolute pose, for example from loop detection, which is more accurate than the integral of the relative rigid-body motions. The availability of this absolute information is usually less frequent than the information underlying the relative rigid-body motions. This contribution addresses an efficient closed form algorithm which minimally bends a trajectory such that the integrated pose is exactly equal to any particular desired pose. The manner in which the bending is distributed over the trajectory is controllable using weights. The proposed method will be compared against a maximum likelihood solution on simulated trajectories as well as on trajectories estimated from binocular and monocular data. The results indicate that the performance differences between the closed form approach and the maximum likelihood solution are negligible while the closed form approach is significantly more efficient.},

For building a static motion model, we apply the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm to learn motion model parameters as soon as new data (the robot's pose from odometry readings and ground-truth poses) arrive. For building a dynamic motion model, our framework uses the bi-loop recursive least squares (BiRLS) algorithm to learn the parameters on the fly as the robot traverses the environment. These techniques for building motion models are integrated with FastSLAM 2.0 giving increased autonomy to the system by eliminating the human effort required to produce motion models. The performance of our newly acquired motion models are then evaluated objectively based on the robot's ground-truth poses in the context of FastSLAM 2.0.},

The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware.

Drawing inspiration from this observation, in this work we investigate if the awareness of egomotion can be used as a supervisory signal for feature learning. As opposed to the knowledge of class labels, information about egomotion is freely available to mobile agents.

It concurrently estimates the depth at these pixels from two types of stereo cues: Static stereo through the fixed-baseline stereo camera setup as well as temporal multi-view stereo exploiting the camera motion. By incorporating both disparity sources, our algorithm can even estimate depth of pixels that are under-constrained when only using fixed-baseline stereo. Using a fixed baseline, on the other hand, avoids scale-drift that typically occurs in pure monocular SLAM.We furthermore propose a robust approach to enforce illumination invariance, capable of handling aggressive brightness changes between frames – greatly improving the performance in realistic settings.

Specifically, we enforce the propagation Jacobian to obey the semigroup property, thus being an appropriate state-transition matrix. This is achieved by parametrizing the orientation error state in the global, instead of local, frame of reference, and then evaluating the Jacobian at the propagated, instead of the updated, state estimates. Moreover, the EKF linearized system ensures correct observability by projecting the most-accurate measurement Jacobian onto the observable subspace so that no spurious information is gained. The proposed algorithm is validated by both Monte-Carlo simulation and real-world experimental tests.},

Existing work has focused on planning paths with occupancy grid maps, which do not scale well and suffer from long term drift. This work proposes a Topological Feature Graph (TFG) representation that scales well and develops an active SLAM algorithm with it. The TFG uses graphical models, which utilize independences between variables, and enables a unified quantification of exploration and exploitation gains with a single entropy metric. Hence, it facilitates a natural and principled balance between map exploration and refinement. A probabilistic roadmap path-planner is used to generate robot paths in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy than a standard grid-map based approach while requiring orders of magnitude less computation and memory resources.},

In this paper, we analyze the structure of the nonlinear- ities in the 2D SLAM problem formulated as the optimizing of a pose graph. First, we prove that finding the optimal configuration of a very basic pose graph with 3 nodes (poses) and 3 edges (relative pose constraints) with spherical covariance matrices, which can be formulated as a six dimensional least squares optimization problem, is equivalent to solving a one dimensional optimization problem. Then we show that the same result can be extended to the optimizing of a pose graph with “two anchor nodes” where every edge is connecting to one of the two anchor nodes. Furthermore, we prove that the global minimum of the resulting one dimensional optimization problem must belong to a certain interval and there are at most 3 minima in that interval. Thus the globally optimal pose configuration of the pose graph can be obtained very easily through the bisection method and closed-form formulas.},

At the heart of the localisation is the fundamental task of discovering feature correspondences between recorded and live images. One aspect of this problem involves deciding where to look for correspondences in an image and the second is deciding what to look for. This latter point, which is the main focus of our paper, requires understanding how and why the appearance of visual features can change over time. In particular, such knowledge allows us to better deal with abrupt and challenging changes in lighting. We show how by instantiating a parallel image processing stream which operates on illumination-invariant images, we can substantially improve the performance of an outdoor visual navigation system. We will demonstrate, explain and analyse the effect of the RGB to illumination-invariant transformation and suggest that for little cost it becomes a viable tool for those concerned with having robots operate for long periods outdoors.},

Second, overcoming camera pose estimation limitations in a wide variety of environments by combining both dense geometric and photometric camera pose constraints. Third, efficiently updating the dense map according to place recognition and subsequent loop closure constraints by the use of an ‘as-rigid-as-possible' space deformation.

abstract = {Deep convolutional networks have proven to be very successful in learning task specific features that allow for unprecedented performance on various computer vision tasks. Training of such networks follows mostly the supervised learning paradigm, where sufficiently many input-output pairs are required for training. Acquisition of large training sets is one of the key challenges, when approaching a new task. In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and present an approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled data. To this end, we train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. In contrast to supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, Caltech-256). While such generic features cannot compete with class specific features from supervised training on a classification task, we show that they are advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform the SIFT descriptor.},

abstract = {The SLAM problem is known to have a special property that when robot orientation is known, estimating the history of robot poses and feature locations can be posed as a standard linear least squares problem. In this work, we develop a SLAM framework that uses relative feature-to-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of SLAM. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational burden of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for feature-based SLAM. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver.},

@article{Mills1995,
abstract = {Underwater vehicles are employed to perform many tasks: structure inspection, recovery, geographic surveys, e.t.c. but most in current operation require constant human supervision. In an attempt to make these vehicles more autonomous, this research project aims to develop a multivariable, neurofuzzy network controller for application to an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The vehicle being studied is Ocean Voyager, an AUV based at Florida Atlantic University. Ocean Voyager is a torpedo shaped, 22 feet long and 13 inches in diameter with a displacement of 2700 lb. The design speed is 10.1 ft/s, with an overall cruise time of 2 hours. A thruster provides the forward propulsion and the vehicle motion is controlled by two surfaces, the stern plane and rudder. A simulation of the vehicle dynamics has been made available to the ISIS research group but for the purposes of this project it has been treated as a black box. Simulation of the vehicle dynamics is achieved by using the standard submarine equations of motion defined by the David Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Centre (DTNSRDC). Before attempting any control, the problem of modelling the AUV dynamics was studied. The AUV is a nonlinear, multivariable, dynamic process which means that to produce an accurate approximation the selected model must not only be nonlinear but also capable of dealing with high dimensional inputs. The required nonlinearities can be provided by a neurofuzzy system. Neurofuzzy systems combine the positive attributes of a neural network and a fuzzy system. Neural networks have become popular largely due to their ability to universally approximate any continuous nonlinear function using only the information contained in a set of input/output training pairs. The properties of a neural network are determined by its structure and the learning rule used to adapt the weights. Common examples include the multilayer perceptron and the radial basis function network but more recently B-spline networks have been suggested due to their superior numerical properties. The B-spline network belongs to the class of Associative Memory Networks (AMNs) as it generalises locally, i.e. similar inputs map to similar outputs whereas dissimilar inputs map to independent outputs. They also have the advantage that only the output layer weights are adapted which means that well established linear training algorithms can be employed with provable behavioural characteristics. However, a major criticism of most neural networks is their opaque structure where the information stored can not be easily interpreted by the designer. A fuzzy system generally consists of a rule base composed of vague production rules such as IF (error is small) THEN (output is small). The rules are generally linguistic representations and because the information can be easily interpreted by the designer, it is said to be transparent. The power of a fuzzy system lies in the way these production rules are given a precise mathematical meaning so that the resulting system can generalise to produce an appropriate output for previously unseen inputs. However, fuzzy systems have a serious drawback when applied to many applications, their rules are often very difficult or even impossible to determine. This has motivated the development of adaptive fuzzy systems which adjust their rule base parameters via heuristic training rules about which little can be proved. Recently the similarities between neural networks and fuzzy systems have been noted, allowing the positive attributes of both approaches to be combined. The result is termed a neurofuzzy system since it embodies the well established modelling and learning capabilities of a neural networks with the transparent knowledge representation of fuzzy systems. In particular, it has been shown that B-spline networks and certain forms of fuzzy system are equivalent. Unfortunately, these conventional lattice based neurofuzzy systems are limited to problems involving only a small number of inputs. Modelling in high dimensions is difficult due to a phenomenum called the curse of dimensionality, a term first introduced by Bellman in 1961, and which has plagued researchers from many disciplines ever since. The curse can be explained by considering the number of data points need to maintain the same sampling density as the input dimension rises. For example, if the domain of interest is the unit hypercube D = 0,1 n and the required resolution is 0.1 then a minimum of 10 n observations must be stored. Obtaining and storing such a large training set quickly becomes infeasible for n{\textgreater}4. There have many attempts to alleviate the curse of dimensionality and in particular, much progress has been made in the field of statistics. A straightforward and popular approach is to try to exploit structural information which is known (either a priori or is discovered during the training process) about the form of the desired function. For example, an ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) decomposition for an n dimensional function f(x), is expressed as: f(x) = f0 + ... where f0 is the bias and the remaining terms represent the combinations of univariate, bivariate, e.t.c. subfunctions that additively decompose the function f. An ANOVA decomposition describes the relationship between the different input variables but it is only useful if the interactions involving more than say four inputs are identically zero. This constraint could limit the potential for applying an ANOVA representation but often an adequate approximation is still obtained. The question must be asked: are all the nonlinear features important or will a model composed of simple subfunctions suffice? An immediate advantage of the ANOVA representation is that each subfunction can be a lattice based neurofuzzy system and so network transparency is retained. Also, the output is a linear function of the concatenated weight vectors for each subfunction which means the training algorithms derived for conventional neurofuzzy systems still apply. The potential reduction in the number of fuzzy rules can be illustrated by considering the approximation of Powell's function, a system with four inputs and one output. This function is an ideal candidate for an ANOVA decomposition since it contains four, two-dimensional subfunctions. If seven basis functions are used on each axis, the ANOVA system will use approximately 200 rules whereas a conventional neurofuzzy system uses over 2000, the majority of which are redundant.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose the integration of two of the most widely used approaches for the implementation of autonomous navigation systems: the reinforcement learning for path finding, along with SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) type algorithms for localization and mapping of the environment. These two approaches are integrated to address the problem of how a robot should explore an unknown and dynamic environment while it collects perception features in order to locate itself and, at the same time, to obtain information clues about cost traversability of an area. So, when a robot is exploring and mapping with a SLAM algorithm it is also learning to associate perception features with costs and actions to find optimal paths from the starting point to the goal point in dynamical environments.},

abstract = {Consider the two characteristics: (1) Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a popular algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicle, but visual SLAM is significantly influenced by weak illumination. (2)Geomagnetism-aided navigation and gravity-aided navigation are equally important methods in the field of vehicle navigation, but both are affected heavily by time-varying noises and terrain fluctuations. However, magnetic gradient vector can avoid the influence of time-varying noises, and is less affected by terrain fluctuations. To this end, we propose an adaptive SLAM-based magnetic gradient aided navigation with the following advantages: (1) Adaptive SLAM is an efficient way to deal with uncertainty of the measurement model. (2) Magnetic gradient inversion equation is a good alternative to be used as measurement equation in visual SLAM-denied environment. Experimental results show that our proposed method is an effective solution, combining magnetic gradient information with SLAM. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent work on simultaneous trajectory estimation and mapping (STEAM) for mobile robots has used Gaussian processes (GPs) to efficiently represent the robot's trajectory through its environment. GPs have several advantages over discrete-time trajectory representations: they can represent a continuous-time trajectory, elegantly handle asynchronous and sparse measurements, and allow the robot to query the trajectory to recover its estimated position at any time of interest. A major drawback of the GP approach to STEAM is that it is formulated as a batch trajectory estimation problem. In this paper we provide the critical extensions necessary to transform the existing GP-based batch algorithm for STEAM into an extremely efficient incremental algorithm. In particular, we are able to vastly speed up the solution time through efficient variable reordering and incremental sparse updates, which we believe will greatly increase the practicality of Gaussian process methods for robot mapping and localization. Finally, we demonstrate the approach and its advantages on both synthetic and real datasets.},

The first photogrammetric methods were developed in the middle of the 19th century by Laussedat and Meydenbauer for mapping purposes and reconstruction of buildings (Luhmann, 2003). These photogrammetricmethods were based on geometric modelling of the image formation process, exploiting the perspective projection of a three-dimensional scene into a two-dimensional image plane. Image formation by perspective projection corresponds to the pinhole camera model. There are different image formation models, describing optical devices such as fisheye lenses or omnidirectional lenses. In this work, however, we will restrict ourselves to the pinhole model since it represents the most common image acquisition devices.},

abstract = {Keyframe-based SLAM has achieved great success in terms of ac- curacy, efficiency and scalability. However, due to parallax re- quirement and delay of map expansion, traditional keyframe-based methods easily encounter the robustness problem in the challeng- ing cases especially for fast motion with strong rotation. For AR applications in practice, these challenging cases are easily encoun- tered, since a home user may not carefully move the camera to avoid potential problems. With the above motivation, in this paper, we present RKSLAM, a robust keyframe-based monocular SLAM system that can reliably handle fast motion and strong rotation, ensuring good AR experiences. First, we propose a novel multi- homography based feature tracking method which is robust and ef- ficient for fast motion and strong rotation. Based on it, we propose a real-time local map expansion scheme to triangulate the observed 3D points immediately without delay. A sliding-window based camera pose optimization framework is proposed, which imposes the motion prior constraints between consecutive frames through simulated or real IMU data. Qualitative and quantitative compar- isons with the state-of-the-art methods, and an AR application on mobile devices demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ap- proach. Index},

Our pro-posed opportunistic framework leverages sampling-based techniques and information filtering to plan revisit paths that are coverage efficient. We employ Gaussian process regres-sion for modeling the prediction of camera registrations and use a two-step optimization procedure for selecting revisit actions.

abstract = {State of the art visual SLAM systems have recently been presented which are capable of accurate, large-scale and real-time performance, but most of these require stereo vision. Important application areas in robotics and beyond open up if similar performance can be demonstrated using monocular vision, since a single camera will always be cheaper, more compact and easier to calibrate than a multi-camera rig. With high quality estimation, a single camera moving through a static scene of course effectively provides its own stereo geometry via frames distributed over time. However, a classic issue with monocular visual SLAM is that due to the purely projective nature of a single camera, motion estimates and map structure can only be recovered up to scale. Without the known inter-camera distance of a stereo rig to serve as an anchor, the scale of locally constructed map portions and the corresponding motion estimates is therefore liable to drift over time. In this paper we describe a new near real-time visual SLAM system which adopts the continuous keyframe optimisation ap- proach of the best current stereo systems, but accounts for the additional challenges presented by monocular input. In particular, we present a new pose-graph optimisation technique which allows for the efficient correction of rotation, translation and scale drift at loop closures. Especially, we describe the Lie group of similarity transformations and its relation to the corresponding Lie algebra.We also present in detail the systems new image processing front-end which is able accurately to track hundreds of features per frame, and a filter-based approach for feature initialisation within keyframe-based SLAM. Our approach is proven via large-scale simulation and real-world experiments where a camera completes large looped trajectories.},

Our paper presents and evaluates a robust back-end formulation for SLAM using switchable constraints. Instead of proposing yet another appearance-based data association technique, our system is able to recognize and reject outliers during the optimization. This is achieved by making the topology of the underlying factor graph representation subject to the optimization instead of keeping it fixed. The evaluation shows that the approach can deal with up to 1000 false positive loop closure constraints on various datasets.

abstract = {can be formulated as convex optimization programs. An Achilles' heel in input design is that the solution depends on the system itself, and this problem can be handled by iterative procedures where the input design is based on a model of the system. Benefits of optimal input design are quantified for typical industrial appli- cations. The result shows that the experiment time can be substantially shortened and that the input power can be reduced. Another contribution of the thesis is a procedure where input design is connected to robust control. For a certain system structure with uncertain parameters, it is shown that the existence of a feedback controller that guarantees a given performance specification can be formulated as a convex optimization program. Furthermore, a method for input design for mul- tivariable systems is proposed. The constraint on the model quality is transformed to a linear matrix inequality using a separation of graphs theorem. The result in- dicates that in order to obtain a model suitable for control design, it is important to increase the power of the input in the low-gain direction of the system relative to the power in the high-gain direction. A critical issue when validating closed-loop stability is to obtain an accurate estimate of the maximum gain of the system. This problem boils down to finding the input signal that maximizes the gain. Procedures for gain estimation of nonlinear systems are proposed and compared. One approach uses a model of the system to design the optimal input. In other approaches, no model is required, and the system itself determines the optimal input sequence in repeated experiments.},

abstract = {— This paper reports on a novel technique to visually detect loop closings in feature-poor underwater environments in order to increase the accuracy of vision-based localization systems. The main problem of the classical visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for underwater vehicles is the lack of robust, stable and matchable features in certain aquatic environments. The presence of sandbanks, seagrass or other underwater phenomena cause the visual features to concentrate in regions heavily textured, leaving great image areas completely free of visual information. In this situation, the classical loop closing detection algorithms fail, resulting in no corrections for the SLAM system. Our novel method proposes to reinforce the loop closing detection by clustering visual keypoints present in multiple keyframes and to match features of clusters instead of features of keyframes. This new technique is assessed on the particular application of navigating an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in ma-rine environments colonized with seagrass or with the presence of sandbanks. Experiments conducted in several coastal zones on the Balearic Islands show a high degree of success in the visual registration of overlapping areas.},

Our paper presents and evaluates a robust back-end formulation for SLAM using switchable constraints. Instead of proposing yet another appearance-based data association technique, our system is able to recognize and reject out- liers during the optimization. This is achieved by making the topology of the underlying factor graph representation subject to the optimization instead of keeping it fixed. The evaluation shows that the approach can deal with up to 1000 false positive loop closure constraints on various datasets. This largely increases the robustness of the overall SLAM system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers},

abstract = {Most of the works published on hydrodynamic parameter identification of open-frame underwater vehicles focus their attention almost exclusively on good coherence between simulated and measured responses, giving less importance to the determination of “actual values” for hydrodynamic parameters. To gain insight into hydrodynamic parameter experimental identification of open-frame underwater vehicles, an experimental identification procedure is proposed here to determine parameters of uncoupled and coupled models. The identification procedure includes: (i) a prior estimation of actual values of the forces/torques applied to the vehicle, (ii) identification of drag parameters from constant velocity tests and (iii) identification of inertia and coupling parameters from oscillatory tests; at this stage, the estimated values of drag parameter obtained in item (ii) are used. The procedure proposed here was used to identify the hydrodynamic parameters of LAURS—an unmanned underwater vehicle developed at the University of S{\~{a}}o Paulo. The thruster–thruster and thruster–hull interactions and the advance velocity of the vehicle are shown to have a strong impact on the efficiency of thrusters appended to open-frame underwater vehicles, especially for high advance velocities. Results of tests with excitation in 1-DOF and 3-DOF are reported and discussed, showing the feasibility of the developed procedure.},

abstract = {Mobile autonomous systems are very important for marine scientific investigation and military applications. Many algorithms have been studied to deal with the computational efficiency problem required for large scale simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and its related accuracy and consistency. Among these methods, submap-based SLAM is a more effective one. By combining the strength of two popular mapping algorithms, the Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) and extended information filter (EIF), this paper presents a combined SLAM-an efficient submap-based solution to the SLAM problem in a large scale environment. RBPF-SLAM is used to produce local maps, which are periodically fused into an EIF-SLAM algorithm. RBPF-SLAM can avoid linearization of the robot model during operating and provide a robust data association, while EIF-SLAM can improve the whole computational speed, and avoid the tendency of RBPF-SLAM to be over-confident. In order to further improve the computational speed in a real time environment, a binary-tree-based decision-making strategy is introduced. Simulation experiments show that the proposed combined SLAM algorithm significantly outperforms currently existing algorithms in terms of accuracy and consistency, as well as the computing efficiency. Finally, the combined SLAM algorithm is experimentally validated in a real environment by using the Victoria Park dataset.},

abstract = {This paper will present a robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) applied to the navigation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques. Conventional Kalman Filter methods suffer from the assumption of Gaussian noise statistics, which often lead to failures when these assumptions do not hold. Additionally, the linearization errors associated with the implementation of the standard EKF can also severely degrade the performance of the localization estimate. Currently, Stochastic Mapping provides a framework for the concurrent mapping of landmarks and localization of the vehicle with respect to the landmarks. However, the Stochastic Map is essentially an augmented EKF with the limitations thereof. This research addresses the linearization and Guassian assumption errors as they relate to the SLAM problem by proposing a new method, Robust Stochastic Mapping. The Robust Stochastic Map uses a Robust EKF (REKF) in order to address these limitations through the implementation of the bounded H∞ norm.

abstract = {Where feature points are used in real-time frame-rate applications, a high-speed feature detector is necessary. Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7{\%} of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120{\%}) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300{\%}) can operate at full frame rate. Clearly a high-speed detector is of limited use if the features produced are unsuitable for downstream processing. In particular, the same scene viewed from two different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations [1]. Hence the second contribution of this paper is a comparison corner detectors based on this criterion applied to 3D scenes. This comparison supports a number of claims made elsewhere concerning existing corner detectors. Further, contrary to our initial expectations, we show that despite being principally constructed for speed, our detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors according to this criterion.},

@article{Thrun2004,
abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

@article{Prasad2016,
abstract = {Effective SLAM using a single monocular camera is highly preferred due to its simplicity. However, when compared to trajectory planning methods using depth-based SLAM, Monocular SLAM in loop does need additional considerations. One main reason being that for the optimization, in the form of Bundle Adjustment (BA), to be robust, the SLAM system needs to scan the area for a reasonable duration. Most monocular SLAM systems do not tolerate large camera rotations between successive views and tend to breakdown. Other reasons for Monocular SLAM failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the Essential Matrix, feature-sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart from BA. This paper presents a novel formulation based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the SLAM generated outputs (scene structure and camera motion) do not deviate largely from their true values. Quintessentially, the RL framework successfully learns the otherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that result in trajectories that do not cause failure of SLAM, which are almost intractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation. We show systematically in simulations how the quality of the SLAM map and trajectory dramatically improves when trajectories are computed by using RL.},

@article{Maimone2005,
abstract = {NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) were designed to traverse in Viking Lander-I style terrains: mostly flat, with many small non-obstacle rocks and occasional obstacles. During actual operations in such terrains, on- board position estimates derived solely from the onboard In- ertial Measurement Unit and wheel encoder-based odome- try achieved well within the design goal of at most 10{\%} er- ror. However, MER vehicles were also driven along slippery slopes tilted as high as 31 degrees. In such conditions an ad- ditional capability was employed to maintain a sufficiently accurate onboard position estimate: Visual Odometry. The MER Visual Odometry system comprises onboard software for comparing stereo pairs taken by the pointable mast-mounted 45 degree FOV Navigation cameras (NAV- CAMs). The system computes an update to the 6-DOF rover pose (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) by tracking the motion of autonomously-selected ”interesting” terrain features be- tween two pairs of stereo images, in both 2D pixel and 3D world coordinates. A maximum likelihood estimator is ap- plied to the computed 3D offsets to produce a final, corrected estimate of vehicle motion between the two pairs. In this paper we describe the Visual Odometry algorithm used on the Mars Exploration Rovers, and summarize its re- sults from the first year of operations on Mars.},
